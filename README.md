## Brewing Blooms: A Cafe Develop Project

As part of our Web Development project, we developed a coffee shop website using Laravel for the backend and React for the frontend. The website features a variety of features, including a menu, and an ordering system. It is designed to be user-friendly and informative, and it is intended to appeal to a wide range of coffee lovers.
